# GPhotoPaper User Stories

This document outlines the user stories for the application, categorized into MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and Post-MVP features.

## MVP User Stories

These stories represent the core functionality required for the initial release.

*   **As a user, I want to securely connect my OneDrive account** so the application can access my photos and folders.
*   **As a user, I want to see a list of my existing folders from OneDrive** so I can select one to use as the source for my wallpapers.
*   **As a user, I want the option to create a new folder in OneDrive from within the app** to easily designate a new set of wallpaper photos.
*   **As a user, I want the application to set my desktop wallpaper to a photo from my selected OneDrive folder.**
*   **As a user, I want the wallpaper to change automatically at a configurable interval** so I can enjoy a fresh view without manual effort.
*   **As a user, I want to be able to manually trigger a wallpaper change** so I can get a new photo on demand.
*   **As a user, I want to see the application status and access controls through a menu bar icon.**
*   **As a user, I want to be able to launch the application at login** so that it's always running.

## Post-MVP / Nice-to-Have Stories

These are features that would add significant value but are not essential for the initial launch.

*   **Multiple Monitor Support:** As a user with multiple monitors, I want to configure how wallpapers are displayed across my screens (e.g., the same image on all, or a different image on each).
*   **Photo Filtering:** As a user, I want to filter photos in a folder by orientation (landscape/portrait) to avoid distorted or poorly cropped wallpapers.
*   **Offline Cache:** As a user, I want the application to cache a number of photos locally so it can continue to change wallpapers even when I'm offline.
*   **Photo History:** As a user, I want to see a history of recently used wallpapers and be able to revert to a previous one I liked.
*   **Advanced Scheduling:** As a user, I want more advanced scheduling options for wallpaper changes (e.g., change every hour, change on wake from sleep).
*   **Display Photo Info:** As a user, I want to easily see the filename or details of the currently displayed wallpaper.
*   **Multi-Account Support:** As a user, I want to be able to authorize and switch between multiple OneDrive accounts.
